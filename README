This repository contains my first paper, based on my Masters' thesis and a
first small step towards my PhD.

It was initially submitted to WoWMoMM15, titled "id-foo: A framework for
efficient Intrusion Detection in the Internet of Things", but was rejected.

Inspired by my more current research topics, the spirit of the paper was
adapted and updated. The paper in this form will be submitted to EUSPN15.
