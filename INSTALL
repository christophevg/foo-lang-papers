The classes and styles used for these papers are:

- for WoWMoM15: the IEEEtrans class is available through TeX-Live

- for EUSPN15: the adapted Elsevier class is downloaded and added to this
  repository. It can be installed using the following commands:
  
  $ ROOT=`kpsewhich -expand-var='$TEXMFHOME'`
  $ mkdir -p "$ROOT/tex/latex/"
  $ cp -r ecrc-procs "$ROOT/tex/latex/elsarticle"
  
  The commands are also implemented as an "install" target in the Makefile.
